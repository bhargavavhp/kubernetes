## Questions on Probes in Kubernetes

### Q: if we use startup probe then can we ignore initialdelayseconds

The initialDelaySeconds field is used to specify the number of seconds to wait before starting the first probe after a container is started. The purpose of this delay is to allow the container's internal components to start up and become ready before the readiness probe starts checking if the container is ready.

On the other hand, the `startupProbe` field is used to specify a separate probe that checks whether the application within the container has started up correctly. Unlike the `readinessProbe`, the **`startupProbe`** runs only once when the container is first started up, and is not run again after that.

So, while the `startupProbe` can help determine if the application within the container has started up correctly, it does not replace the need for the initialDelaySeconds field. The initialDelaySeconds is still important to ensure that the container's internal components have enough time to start up before the readiness probe begins checking the container's readiness.

Therefore, it's recommended to use both initialDelaySeconds and `startupProbe` together to ensure that your containers are properly configured and ready to handle requests.



### Q: suppose we are using both startupprobe and initialdelayseconds, now application has started correctly and startupprobe exits, does initialdelayseconds be checked for every restart 
Yes, even if the `startupProbe` succeeds and the application within the container has started correctly, the initialDelaySeconds field will still be checked every time the container is restarted.

The purpose of the initialDelaySeconds field is to provide a delay before the `readinessProbe` starts checking the container's readiness. This delay is intended to ensure that the container's internal components have had enough time to start up and become ready before the readiness check begins.

Since the initialDelaySeconds field is part of the container's specification, it will be used by Kubernetes to determine when the readiness probe should start checking the container's readiness, regardless of whether the startup probe succeeds or not.

Therefore, it's important to ensure that the initialDelaySeconds field is set to an appropriate value to allow the container's internal components enough time to start up and become ready, even if the `startupProbe` succeeds.



### Q: while the above case, container startup time is more then still there is a disadvantage that startup time may vary and there is a requirement for startupprobe in the restarts as well?
Yes, it is true that the container startup time may vary, and there is a possibility that the startup time may exceed the initialDelaySeconds value specified in the container's specification. In such cases, it's possible that the readiness probe may start checking the container's readiness before its internal components are fully ready, resulting in failed readiness checks.

Using a `startupProbe` can help mitigate this risk by providing an additional probe that specifically checks whether the application within the container has started up correctly. If the `startupProbe` succeeds, it indicates that the container is ready to start accepting requests, even if the initialDelaySeconds value has not elapsed.

However, as you mentioned, it's also important to consider the case of container restarts. Even if the `startupProbe` succeeds during the initial startup, it's possible that the application may fail to start up correctly during subsequent restarts. Therefore, it's important to ensure that the `startupProbe` is configured to run every time the container is restarted, to ensure that the application has started up correctly before the readiness probe starts checking the container's readiness.

In summary, using both initialDelaySeconds and `startupProbe` can help ensure that your containers are properly configured and ready to handle requests, even in cases where the container startup time may vary or the container is restarted.



### Q: ok, then can you show an example how startupprobe can be configured to run everytime container/pod is restarted
Sure! Here's an example of how to configure a `startupProbe` to run every time a container is restarted:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: example-container
    image: nginx
    readinessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /
        port: 80
      initialDelaySeconds: 5
      periodSeconds: 10
    startupProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /
        port: 80
      periodSeconds: 10
    lifecycle:
      restartPolicy: Always
```
In this example, we've added a `startupProbe` field to the container's specification. We've also set the restartPolicy to Always, which means that the container will be automatically restarted if it fails or exits.

With this configuration, the `startupProbe` will run every time the container is restarted, in addition to running during the initial startup. The periodSeconds field is set to 10 seconds, which means that the `startupProbe` will run once every 10 seconds, and the initialDelaySeconds field is not needed as it's already taken care by startup probe.

It's important to note that the `startupProbe` is not a replacement for the `readinessProbe`, and both should be used together to ensure that the container is properly configured and ready to handle requests. In this example, we've also included a `readinessProbe` that checks if the container is ready to handle requests by making an HTTP GET request to the / path on port 80. The initialDelaySeconds field for the `readinessProbe` is set to 5 seconds, which means that the readiness probe will start checking the container's readiness 5 seconds after the container starts.



### Q: then what is the use of initaldelayseconds if startupprobe can override the initialdelayseconds if restartpolicy is set to always
You are correct that if the container's restartPolicy is set to Always and a `startupProbe` is configured, then the initialDelaySeconds field may not be necessary.

The initialDelaySeconds field is typically used to delay the start of the `readinessProbe` to give the container time to start up and become ready. However, if a `startupProbe` is configured, it may be able to determine when the container is ready to handle requests more accurately than waiting for a fixed period specified by initialDelaySeconds.

Using a `startupProbe` allows you to define a more specific probe that checks the readiness of the application running within the container, whereas the initialDelaySeconds field is a general delay that is applied to all probes.

So, in summary, the initialDelaySeconds field may not be necessary if a `startupProbe` is configured and the container's restartPolicy is set to Always. However, if a `startupProbe` is not configured, or if the container's restartPolicy is set to something other than Always, then the initialDelaySeconds field may still be useful to ensure that the `readinessProbe` does not start checking the container's readiness too soon after it starts up.



### Q: how livenessprobe and readinessprobe can be used cobinedly with startupprobe which has restart policy as always 
You can use `livenessProbe`, `readinessProbe`, and `startupProbe` together with a container that has a restartPolicy of Always. Here is an example YAML definition for a pod that demonstrates how to use all three probes together:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  restartPolicy: Always
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: nginx
    livenessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /
        port: 80
    readinessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /
        port: 80
      initialDelaySeconds: 10
      periodSeconds: 5
    startupProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /
        port: 80
      periodSeconds: 5
```
In this example, we have set a restartPolicy of Always to ensure that the container is restarted if it fails or exits. We have also specified three different types of probes:

`livenessProbe`: checks whether the container is still running. In this example, we have used an HTTP GET request to the root URL of the container's web server to determine whether it is still running.
`readinessProbe`: checks whether the container is ready to start handling requests. In this example, we have used an HTTP GET request to the root URL of the container's web server and set an initialDelaySeconds of 10 seconds to allow the container time to start up before checking its readiness. The periodSeconds is set to 5 seconds, which means that the probe will be run every 5 seconds after the initial delay.
`startupProbe`: checks whether the container has started up correctly. In this example, we have used an HTTP GET request to the root URL of the container's web server and set a periodSeconds of 5 seconds to ensure that the probe runs periodically.
With these probes in place, Kubernetes will be able to detect whether the container is still running, whether it is ready to handle requests, and whether it has started up correctly. If any of these checks fail, the container will be automatically restarted, ensuring that it is always available to handle requests.



### Q: how startupprobe and restart policy always work together and list out all the cases
Sure, here are all the cases when using `startupProbe` and restartPolicy: Always together:

 - If the container is starting up for the first time, the `startupProbe` will be run to determine whether the container has started up correctly. If the `startupProbe` fails, the container will be restarted until the `startupProbe` succeeds.

 - Once the container has started up successfully, the `readinessProbe` will be run periodically to determine whether the container is ready to handle requests. If the `readinessProbe` fails, the container will be restarted until the `readinessProbe` succeeds.

 - If the `readinessProbe` succeeds and the container is running, the `livenessProbe` will be run periodically to determine whether the container is still running. If the `livenessProbe` fails, the container will be restarted until the `livenessProbe` succeeds.

 - If the container crashes or exits, the restartPolicy: Always will cause the container to be restarted. The `startupProbe` will be run again to determine whether the container has started up correctly, and the process will repeat from step 1.

In summary, `startupProbe` is used to check whether the container has started up correctly, `readinessProbe` is used to check whether the container is ready to handle requests, and `livenessProbe` is used to check whether the container is still running. If any of these probes fail, the container will be restarted until the probe succeeds. If the container crashes or exits, it will be restarted and the process will repeat.
